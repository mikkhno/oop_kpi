Lana Del Rey - Radio
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I'll be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy I've been raised from the dead
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you
Oh, sing it to me
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
